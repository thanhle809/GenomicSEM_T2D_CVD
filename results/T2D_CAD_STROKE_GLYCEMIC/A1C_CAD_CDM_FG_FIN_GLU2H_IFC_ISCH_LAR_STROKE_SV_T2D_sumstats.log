The preparation of 12 summary statistics for use in Genomic SEM began at: 2024-05-20 12:40:35.940535
Please note that the files should be in the same order that they were listed for the ldsc function
Reading in reference file
Applying MAF filer of 0.01 to the reference file.
All files loaded into R!



Preparing summary statistics for file: A1C_withNeff.txt
Found an NEFF column for sample size. 

Please note that this is likely effective sample size and should only be used for liability h^2 conversion for binary traits and that it should reflect the sum of effective sample sizes across cohorts.

Be aware that some NEFF columns reflect half of the effective sample size; the function will automatically double the column names if recognized [check above in .log file to determine if this is the case].
If the Neff value is halved in the summary stats, but not recognized by the munge function, this should be manually doubled prior to running munge.
Interpreting the SNP column as the SNP column.
Interpreting the A1 column as the A1 column.
Interpreting the A2 column as the A2 column.
Interpreting the BETA column as the effect column.
Interpreting the PVALUE column as the P column.
Interpreting the NEFF column as the N column.
Interpreting the MAF column as the MAF column.
Interpreting the STDERR column as the SE column.
0 rows were removed from the A1C_withNeff.txt summary statistics file due to entries that were duplicated for rsID. These are removed as they likely reflect multiallelic variants.
Merging file: A1C_withNeff.txt with the reference file: snplist.txt
127981 rows present in the full A1C_withNeff.txt summary statistics file.
127981 rows were removed from the A1C_withNeff.txt summary statistics file as the rsIDs for these SNPs were not present in the reference file.
